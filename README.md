# Chapter 17
This repository is to emulate Tom Marvolo Riddle revealing he is Voldemort to Harry Potter in the Chamber of Secrets. This is Chapter 17 from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

_Scene excerpt:_
> "Why do you care how I escaped?" said Harry slowly. "Voldemort was after your time..."
>
> "Voldemort," said Riddle softly, "is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter..."
>
> He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:
>
> TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
>
> Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:
>
> I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
