# Chapter 17
This repository is to emulate the [scene](https://youtu.be/cGNFXl5O2o8?t=149) where Tom Marvolo Riddle reveals he is Voldemort to Harry Potter, down in the Chamber of Secrets. This is Chapter 17 from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

_Scene excerpt:_
> "Why do you care how I escaped?" said Harry slowly. "Voldemort was after your time..."
>
> "Voldemort," said Riddle softly, "is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter..."
>
> He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:
>
> TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
>
> Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:
>
> I AM LORD VOLDEMORT

## Working
As you will notice, once you click on the url, the name prints character by character ~~as if Riddle is typing on the other side of the screen~~. You would need to hover your cursor over the name (as to imitate Riddle's wand wave motion) to get it to reveal the ✨truth of his identity✨.
